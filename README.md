## Inspiration 
Omnia is a true COVID-era creation.
The creators of Omnia realized that the pandemic posed problems for many people- epecially the elderly or those without access to transportation. Taking public transportation is 
is difficult and even moreso, dangerous at this time but there are still tasks to be completed, errands to be run. Omnia allows those without access to transportation services to 
be able to have their tasks done stress-free! 

And for those looking to make extra money in this diffuclt time, Omnia allows you to make money while completing errands. Already on your way to the post ofice and see 
someone who need a task at the post office completed? You can accept the job and make money - no extra trips required, you basically get your gas covered!
